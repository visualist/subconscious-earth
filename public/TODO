 POSSIBLE BUG: Do I have a bug between when the Flickr response returns (and
 seems to work find) and getting the model created? Something seems to get
 lost between these two pieces, for some of the items, judging from the console
 messages.


 -- [DONE] use magnitude for opacity
 -- [DONE] implement removes

 1. consider, when no images are found for a given lat-long, then using
    the corpus-text to create search terms for image-lookup
    -- [partially working] secondary search when the first attempt at
       getting an image does not result

 2. depth for canvas blur - probably will have to proxy the flickr requests
 2b. z-index should also vary by earthquake depth value

 3. implement updates: provide ongoing changes (ie, diminish image)

 4. image width to match viewport
    -- CSS (and markup) adjustments to rid the horizontal/vertical scrollbars
       present problem probably due to a little margin/padding
