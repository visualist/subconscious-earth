 POSSIBLE BUG: Do I have a bug between when the Flickr response returns (and
 seems to work find) and getting the model created? Something seems to get
 lost between these two pieces, for some of the items, judging from the console
 messages.


 1. [DONE] use magnitude for opacity
 2. [DONE] implement removes

 3. implement updates: provide ongoing changes (ie, diminish image)
 4. depth for canvas blur - probably will have to proxy the flickr requests

 * consider, when no images are found for a given lat-long, then using
   the corpus-text to create search terms for image-lookup

 * image width to match viewport
   * CSS (and markup) adjustments to rid the horizontal/vertical scrollbars

 * [partially working] secondary search when the first attempt at getting
   an image does not result. need to incorporate the corpus-lookup into this
   process
