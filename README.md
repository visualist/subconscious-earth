Subconscious Earth
==================

If the Earth were to dream, what would it dream? And how would we
interpret her dreams?

Human dreams are a function of the brain while in a subconscious
state during which certain older parts of the brain, such as the
brainstem and mid-brain, create stimuli which, in turn, activate
higher brain activity in the cortex. These stimuli access memories
in non-linear combinations. The two parts--stimuli and memory--weave
together into a seemingly nonsensical narrative. However, there
remains a connection to reality since the raw materials are rooted
in real memories. Freudian psychologists spend a great deal of time
interpreting dreams.

A parallel exists within the Earth. We observe stimuli from the
Earth as earthquakes, some large, some slight, some originate from
very deep within the Earth while others are at the surface. The
Earth is actively producing seismic stimuli at locations over its
surface. There is a memory also, in the form of photographic images
captured by a collective humanity and subsequently made available
on sites such as Flickr. Many of these photographs are geo-coded,
meaning longitude and latitude data are available (in fact,
searchable). So matching seismic activity with imagery can be done
through longitude and latitude.


My project, Subconscious Earth, attempts to interpret the Earth's
dreams through a temporal manifestation of combined imagery resulting
from Earth's seismic stimuli: it monitors worldwide seismic data
from the USGS and reacts to the earthquakes as they occur by finding
Flickr images and meshing the imagery together with recent activity
(events older than an hour are forgotten). One image is associated
with each seismic event, it's longitude, latitude, magnitude and
depth. These four data-points are used in rendering the combination
of images to influence opacity & blur, in order to represent (reflect)
these data.

Most seismic activity on an hourly basis consist of very small,
sometimes imperceptible, earthquakes. In response, Subconscious
Earth renders a soupy mixture, but if a significant event were to
occur, it would stand out in contrast. In effect, this is a real-time
data visualization, only its representation is further decoupled
from concrete meaning. It is, after all, suggestive of the dream.
